# Designing a database for managing a summer camp
This project was developed for the exam of Information Systems and Databases at Universit√† Politecnica delle Marche.
Made by Matteo Giri, Lorenzo Tiseni, Andrea Camilloni.

## Introduction
The purpose of our project is to create a database for the summer camp organized by the Salesian oratory of Porto Recanati (MC).
This choice arose because one of the group members, Lorenzo, has served as an animator for the oratory several times and has informed us about some issues the oratory had regarding the management of the
center and how a database could simplify many of the operations carried out. The summer camp is responsible for organizing recreational activities for children, including games, workshops, and outings
from the beginning of the second week of June until the end of the first week of July.
